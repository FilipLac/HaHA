# Halloween Hunting Adventure
This project was created for our school assignment. 
<hr>
Previously it contained all files, but now here are just game files and releases, with website code moved to different repository. 

## Current state of the game
This project is for now put on hold, since we finished this presentation and only I still have licence for GameMaker MV (engine for this game).
Maybe in future, I could finish this game and fix some pesky bugs, but for now, it will remain as it is

## To-do
- Fix bugs
- Some textures aren't solid (player can walk on top of them)
- Hidden secret is really hard to find (add some small hint)
- Hidden second ending is for now disabled
- Game-logic gets sometimes broken...
